let's swap so that it becomes:
pmv XOR rbk -> z13
pmv AND rbk -> hsw

---

also,
this looks wrong:

dig z08
 z08 = XOR btr bjm
  btr = XOR x08 y08
   x08 wire 0
   y08 wire 0
  bjm = XOR tgj mkm
   tgj = XOR y07 x07
   mkm = OR dvw cbn

because of bjm.
should we swap that with z07 perhaps?

let's swap so that it becomes:
njc OR kbk -> bjm
tgj XOR mkm -> z07

--

then there is z18
let's inspect
bgt XOR qjc -> skf
y18 XOR x18 -> qjc
bgt AND qjc -> tgm

maybe just guess that skf and z18 should swap.
make it look like so:
bgt XOR qjc -> z18
y18 AND x18 -> skf


---

next problematic output wire is z26
we have this:
x26 XOR y26 -> nvr
y26 AND x26 -> wkr

let's swap them!
